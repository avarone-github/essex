## Computing resources

The requirements of essex in terms of memory, CPU and disk space are extremely variable from case to case.  
The factors to be taken into account are:

- Target performance
- Complexity of the text intelligence engines, whether they are engines with only the fundamental NLU capabilities or they also carry out classification and information extraction and, in this case, with how many rules and which&mdash;if any&mdash;scripting functionality
- Space occupied by the text intelligence engines files
- Log size and possible use of external log rotation mechanisms
