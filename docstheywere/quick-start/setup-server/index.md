# 1. Setup the server

You can download a standard Edge NL API server from the <a href="https://developer.expert.ai" target="_blank">expert.ai developer portal</a>.  
If you don't already have an account, register on the portal, then sign in.  
You will find the Edge NL API packages in the **Developer** section of the portal.

If you use <a href="https://docs.expert.ai/studio/latest/ide/" target="_blank">expert.ai Studio</a>, you can create custom Edge NL API servers that deliver the text intelligence engines corresponding to your projects.  
You just need to <a href="https://docs.expert.ai/studio/latest/ide/how-to/deploy/" target="_blank">deploy the project</a>.  
Custom servers provide both the Natural Language Understanding capabilities of the standard servers and the custom categorization and extraction capabilities you have designed.

The Edge NL API server can be used in both Windows and Linux and the server package includes the startup script for both operating systems:

- Run `runmeWindows.cmd` to start the server on Windows.
- Run `runmeLinux.sh` to start the server on Linux.
